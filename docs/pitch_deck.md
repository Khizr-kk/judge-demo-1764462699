## Slide 2: Problem
**The AI Paradox: Brilliant Ideas, Unclear Business Cases.**
Early-stage AI SaaS founders are visionaries, but they face a critical challenge:

2.  **Articulation Gap:** Struggle to define target users, value, and AI-specific business models.
3.  **Validation Void:** Difficulty in rigorously testing assumptions and identifying blind spots.
**Impact:** Missed market opportunities, stalled development, and difficulty securing crucial funding. This isn't just a founder's headache; it's a drag on the entire AI innovation ecosystem.
